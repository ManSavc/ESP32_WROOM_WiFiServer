Hello, this is projects example from "arduino IDE" how to connect ESP32_wroom to your home WiFi and
control some output pins. I corect "SSID"(your wifi name), "password"(your wifi password) and "pin",
in this project pin was "GPIO 13"

From Arduino IDE , choose File -> Examples -> WiFi -> SimpleWifiServer. Then change parameters what 
you want("ssid", "password", "pin"), in the serial monitor(if everything is ok) we get IP adress in
which we can control our pin.
